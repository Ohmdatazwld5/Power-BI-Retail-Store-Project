# Power-BI-Retail-Store-Project
Project - In United States, there are many stores in which a survey was conducted based on students i.e.
how much they are spending on different kind of purchases like Video games, Indoor games, Toys,
Books, Gadgets etc. In the data set (Student Survey), Store setting is the column that explains the Type
of location in which the store is present. By using data set (Student Survey), try to extract the meaningful Insights.

Industry Type â€“ Retail Store

Data set - Student survey

Problem Statement- Create a Power BI Report:

CREATE: Tabular Visualization, Matrix Visualization, Funnel chart, Pie chart, Scatter plot, Sand dance plot.

Restrict data access for the given users in User mapping table. For ex. Mani deals with Rural area only
so she should be able to view the data which belongs to Rural only, not urban and suburban data.

Publish the report on Power BI cloud service and Design the Master Dashboard consisting of Funnel
chart and scatter plots. Then create a schedule refresh for six times in every 4 hours for the Dashboard in
a day.
